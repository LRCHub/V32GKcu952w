[00:09.49] We all need somebody
[00:12.56] We all want someone to hold
[00:15.24] For when we feel lonely
[00:16.79] And no place feels like home
[00:19.99] We go out the same nights
[00:21.83] Without no one really knowing why
[00:24.40] We all need somebody, hmm-mm
[00:38.40] 
[00:28.16] But I don't know where to go without you by my side
[00:34.39] Oh, I

[00:37.57] I said, "Hey, hello"
[00:40.59] Have you ever been to Rio?
[00:42.54] To Jamaica or Tokyo?
[00:45.40] Had drinks in Malibu
[00:47.41] I said, "Hey, hello"
[00:49.69] We could see the Mona Lisa
[00:51.91] Fly to Rome and try the pizza
[00:54.62] Oh, anywhere will do

[01:11.42] Be my valentine
[01:12.55] Come dance to the city lights
[01:14.32] The man along the river bank
[01:17.26] He plays your favorite song
[01:19.10] Take me by the hand, and don't let it go
[01:21.59] Tell me everything, oh, I wanna know
